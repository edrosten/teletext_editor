This program lets you edit teletext.

It assumes that screens are 40x25 only. Given that teletext is thoroughly
obsolete, I don't see the size changing any time soon. The editor is fairly
self explanatory except for the keys (below). The editing process will be
very confusing if you don't understand teletext, but I'd be surprised if
you were reading this if you aren't.

Currently conceal/reveal and boxing isn't supported. 

For those of you coming from BBC Micro land, this is proper teletext support
not Mode 7 support. Mode 7 does mangling on characters in the range 0-127, such
as by interpreting control characters and putting Â£ in the "right" place. 

This is pure unmangled teletext like you'd get if you send characters with the 
top bit set, as in PRINT CHR$(141).
